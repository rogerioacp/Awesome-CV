\begin{cvparagraph}
I am a software engineer with more than 5 years of experience in distributed systems, databases and cryptography. My curiosity led me to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science where I published 7 scientific papers in peer reviewed conferences, won a best student paper award and developed novel cryptographic database systems. The results of my publication are all available as open source projects. At the same time, I have been working as a research assistant in several European and national R\&D projects that tackle technological or societal problem. My roles within the projects include system design, software development, testing, integration and the final prototype deployment. 
%Additionally, I also mentored new students and integrated them into the team. All of the projects were successfully completed.
